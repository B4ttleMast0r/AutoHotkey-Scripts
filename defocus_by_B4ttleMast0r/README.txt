READ THE WHOLE README!
How-To below.
Description:
	A very simple AutoHotkey Script that effectively defocuses all your windows upon pressing Alt+F7.
	Actually focuses the Task Bar, which has practically the same effect. Instructions on how to use this below.
	It's Alt+F7 and not just F7 so that you won't have any Problems if you use F7 for something else.
	I chose F7 because it doesn't have an action assigned to it by default on most PCs without Fn.
How-To:	
	Run this in AutoHotkey ( https://autohotkey.com/ )
		1. Install AutoHotkey ( https://www.autohotkey.com/download/ )
		2. Select my defocus_by_B4ttleMast0r.ahk file
		3. Open the context menu ( rightclick my file )
		4. In the rightclick-context-menu, click "Run"
		5. Now the Program should be running.
		Press Alt+F7 ( the Alt Key and the F7 Key at the same Time)
		to focus your task bar, effectively defocusing all other windows.
		6. extra info: select "Edit" to edit the file, if you know what you're doing 
		( Tutorial: https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm )
	Stopping the script:
		1. Locate where your Process Symbols are displayed 
		( on Windows normally the bottom-right-corner of your screen,
		to the left of the date, time and the abbreviation of your current keyboard language
		( for example ENG for English ) )
		2. rightclick on the autohotkey icon OR
		if it's not there click on the "more" arrow to see the rest of the symbols, then rightclick the icon
		3. click "Exit"
		4. extra info: click "Pause Script" to temporarily pause the script. Click it again later to resume the script
		click "Edit this Script" to edit the script if you know what you're doing 
		( Tutorial: https://autohotkey.com/docs/Tutorial.htm )
		I recommend using the Notepad++ Text Editor: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/
		click "Reload this Script" to apply changes you made to the script while it was running
		5. if you can't use this Method, 
		for example because a program locks you from seeing the symbols 
		or you don't want to focus something else than your currently focused program,
		you can also use the secret F7+F4 Hotkey.
		Stops the Script completely.
	How to make the script automatically start each time you start your PC:
		1. Run my autostart.bat file.
		2. If it asks for confirmation and/or your admin password, confirm.
		3. close the cmd.exe window.
		4. Done (hopefully. message me if it doesn't work).
